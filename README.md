## Overview
In the app, you can create workouts with exercises of your choice. At first the app asks you for the muscle that you want to train and which difficulty the exercises should be. After selecting the muscle, an api (Api Ninjas Exercises API) returns some exercises. You can add these exercises to your workout and you can view instructions for them. After that you click done. If you want, you can add exercises for another muscle or you complete like that. Then the workout is saved in the shared preferences. In the Navigation you can navigate to the saved workouts and delete, edit or start them. If you start a workout you can swipe each exercise away, meaning you completed it. You can give up the workout or finish it, then you get navigated to the associated activity.
